# MCIA

### MCIA (Make CSS !important Again) is a web utility which has only one job: make every line in your stylesheet !important... again.

NOTE: I am aware that doing this is not recommended for most cases and generally considered as "bad form". This utility was helpful for me because it made sense to use it for a Chrome extension I am working on which injects a new stylesheet and needs to override the original page's CSS.
